# `git reflog-ui`

Makes it even easier to find your lost commits in the [`git reflog`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog).

## Installation

git-reflog-ui requires `libgit2` to be installed using homebrew before building.

```sh
brew install libgit2
```

I recommend using the awesome utility [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) for installation.

```sh
mint install danielctull-apps/git-reflog-ui
```

## Usage

git reflog-ui can only be run from the command line. When inside your working directory running the following will pop open the floating window.

```sh
git reflog-ui
```
